# Introduction

Hi everyone Meth here, and welcome to my blog. Is this gonna be one of those
coder blogs where they abandon it in a few months and move on with their lives?
Hopefully not. I'll be posting regular updates on my ongoing projects and write
a few blog posts about the things i've learned along the way.

This blog wont be limited to coding but would hopefully cover most of my
interests

### 1. Why do a blog?

I wanted to talk about stuff that interests me, and share it with the world.
Conventional social media formats really don't work with information that's
structured this way, hence the blog. It's basically a glorified markdown 
renderer, posts are written in MD and converted to static files on build using
gatsby.

### 2. Why build a site from scratch?

I honestly had so much fun building this, wouldn't have had it any other way. 
This was my first time using GatsbyJS for something too, naturally it made sense
to build it from scratch.
P.S. Everything's open source and on GitHub

### 3. What's the tech stack

You're reading a coder's blog after all, whoever you're, I'm pretty sure that
you'd be interested in knowing how they've built it. So here goes,

The whole codebase uses Gatsby with ReactJS which converts all the blogs
(written as markdown files), into static HTML. Which is better for search
engine optimization, faster site loads and all that jazz. TailwindCSS is used
for styling. It was pretty annoying at first since tailwind clears all the
default styles but convenient in the long run. I had to define most of the
markdown styles (pretty much all of it) in a global CSS file, which is not
ideal, but hey, it works.

### 4. What should you expect?

Pretty much a mashup of everything from computer graphics, electronics,
photography, Linux to Abhidhamma, Physics and my random ass thoughts. Expect a
post every week or so but don't count on it ;)
