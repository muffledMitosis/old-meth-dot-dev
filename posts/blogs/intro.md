# Introduction

Hi everyone Meth here. Is this gonna be one of those coder blogs where 
they abandon it in a few months and move on with their lives? Hopefully not.
I'll be posting regular updates on my ongoing projects and write a few blog 
posts about the things i've learned along the way. 

This blog wont be limited to coding but would hopefully cover most my interests

### 1. Why do a blog?

I wanted to talk about stuff that interests me, and share it with the world.
Conventional social media formats really don't work with information that's
structured this way, hence the blog. It's basically a glorified markdown 
renderer, posts are written in MD and converted to static files on build using
gatsby.

### 2. Why build a site from scratch?

I honestly had so much fun building this, wouldn't have had it any other way. 
P.S. Everything's open source and on GitHub

### 3. What should you expect?

Pretty much a mashup of everything from computer graphics, electronics, 
photography, Linux to Abhidharma. Expect a post every week or so but don't count
on it ;)
